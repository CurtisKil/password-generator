# password-generator

With this project I created a random password generator. When a user wants to generate a password they have the ability to choose the length between 8-128 characters and the password will consist of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Once they generate the password they are also able to easily copy the password so that they can paste it and use it, wherever they'd like.

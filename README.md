# password-generator

With this project I created a random password generator. When a user wants to generate a password they have the ability to choose the length that they want and they are also able to easily copy the password so they can paste it and use it, wherever they'd like. The password that is generated will have a length of 8-128 characters and be a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.
